# netcheck

Monitors Internet availability and switches to alternate networks in a 
predefined order if needed. This program gave the Parkbench team more control
over the gateway network than NetworkManager alone provided.

Relies on the _timber_ logging library which can be found at 
https://github.com/park-bench/timber
Also depends on our _confighelper_ library which can be found at
https://github.com/park-bench/confighelper
