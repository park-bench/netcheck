init should copy wifi list into a tuple like this one
(network_name, connected, attempted)

main loop
* check for wired DNS response
    if yes * sleep
    if no  * clear attempted for whole list
           * mark current as attempted
           * check for wifi DNS
                if yes * mark current net as connected
                       * sleep
                if no  * find highest net with attempted = false
                            if not found * disconnect
                                         * connect to highest
                                         * sleep
                            if found * GOTO 5
