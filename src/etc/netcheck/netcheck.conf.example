# netcheck.conf.example
# Example configuration for netcheck.

[General]

# The amount of logging detail. Either of critical, error, warn, info, debug,
#   or trace.
log_level=info

# This daemon gives you the option to run it as the root user. Alternatively, you can run
#   this daemon as the 'netcheck' user, but this requires more setup. See the README.md for
#   more details.
run_as_root=False

# Comma delimited list of NetworkManager connection names listed in priority order.
connection_ids=

# Comma delimited list of DNS servers to use. Pick your own servers here to help prevent
#   fingerprinting of this application. At least two name servers are required.
nameservers=

# Comma delimited list of domains to query for. Again, pick your own domains here to help
#   prevent fingerprinting of this application. At least two domain names are required.
dns_queries=

# Maximum amount of time in seconds for a DNS query lookup. (Cannot be negative.)

# Maximum amount of time in seconds to wait to activate a connection. (Cannot be negative.)

# Maximum amount of time in seconds that can elapse between checks to see if a connection
#   still has access to the Internet. (Cannot be negative.)
connection_periodic_check_time=5

# Amount of time in seconds between attempts to refresh the list of available connections.
#   This value cannot be less than 26 because NetworkManager has problems forgetting
#   connections if this value is any lower. (Effectively, this is the delay between WiFi scan
#   attempts.)

# Some ISPs have minimum usage requirements (like FreedomPop). This is a comma delimited list
#   of connection IDs that netcheck will periodically connect to to ensure their associated
#   ISP accounts do not become deactivated.
required_usage_connection_ids=

# Maximum delay in days before attempting to use the required-usage connections. (Cannot be
#   negative.)
required_usage_max_delay=14

# Maximum delay in seconds before attempting to retry the required-usage connections if prior
#   activation attempts fail. (Cannot be negative.)
required_usage_failed_retry_delay=3600

# The number of seconds between each main program loop iteration. This gives other programs
#   some processing time to do stuff and helps keep your CPU from getting too hot. From the
#   developers' testing, the main loop takes about one second to run, so consider keeping this
#   value relatively high. (Cannot be negative.)
main_loop_delay=.5

# How often to log the list of activated NetworkManager connection names in seconds. (Cannot
#   be negative.)
